**Altronix Engine Lua Edition** is version of [Altronix Engine](https://github.com/Altronix-Team/FNF-AltronixEngine) with lua scripts support.

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.
